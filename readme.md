# Problem Statement 
Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) remains one of the most essential skills for software engineers, competitive programmers, and technical interview candidates.  DSA determines how efficiently we solve problems, design systems, and think computationally — yet traditional learning methods are often boring, theory-heavy, and difficult to stay consistent with.

**Challenges at present**
- **Abstract Concepts:** DSA topics like trees, graphs, and dynamic programming are inherently abstract and difficult to visualize
- **Lack of Context:** Traditional learning materials present algorithms without real-world context or relatable analogies
- **Engagement Gap:** Static textbooks and video lectures fail to maintain student engagement
- **One-Size-Fits-All:** Existing platforms don't adapt explanations to different learning styles
- **Practice Fatigue:** Repetitive problem-solving without gamification leads to burnout

**The Result?** Developers or students start DSA practise, but stop midway.

**DSA Quest** was built to solve this! - *It transforms the rigorous world of DSA into an engaging, gamified, AI-powered learning experience*

**It started with a simple question:**

*What if DSA could be learned the same way players progress through a game — with stories, analogies, XP, levels, achievements, and instant feedback?*

**Gamification is not decoration** — it is cognitive engineering.

Research consistently shows:
- stories improve long-term recall
- analogies enable conceptual reframing ,micro-rewards (XP, badges) improve motivation
- immediate feedback accelerates skill acquisition

**Motivations were**
1. Make hard concepts feel approachable via narratives and analogies generated by a structured LLM agent.
2. Maintain engagement over long study periods through XP, streaks, badges, and level progression.


# Why agents? -- Why are agents the right solution to this problem
Agents are uniquely suited to solve the ** DSA education**  problem because learning algorithms requires **multi-faceted content generation** that goes beyond simple question-answering. A single LLM call cannot simultaneously create a compelling narrative story, generate a relatable analogy, provide actionable learning tips, AND produce syntactically correct code in four different programming languages—each requiring different contexts, tones, and technical constraints. Our sequential agent architecture allows each specialized agent to focus on its specific task (storytelling, analogy creation, code generation) while maintaining coherence through shared state, ensuring that a student learning "Binary Search" receives a cohesive learning experience where the story about a librarian finding books connects meaningfully to the analogy about phone book searches, which then ties into clean, commented code implementations. This modular approach also enables us to iterate and improve individual agents (e.g., making the Story Agent more engaging) without disrupting the entire system, provides built-in resilience through retry mechanisms for API rate limits, and scales effortlessly as we add new content types (like visualizations or complexity analysis) by simply adding new agents to the pipeline—something impossible with monolithic prompt engineering.

### 1. **Multi-Agent Content Generation**
Our system uses a **sequential agent architecture** powered by Google's ADK to generate personalized learning content:
- **Story Agent:** Creates narrative contexts that make abstract algorithms relatable
- **Analogy Agent:** Generates real-world analogies to explain complex concepts
- **Learning Tip Agent:** Provides actionable, beginner-friendly guidance
- **Code Generation Agents:** Produce implementations in Python, Java, C++, and C with detailed comments

### 2. **Gamified Learning Experience**
Three interactive mini-games reinforce learning:
- **Code Rearrangement:** Reconstruct shuffled algorithm implementations
- **Fill-in-the-Blanks:** Complete code snippets with missing logic
- **Concept Quizzes:** Test understanding with multiple-choice questions

# 1. Notebook Overview & Requirements

### What this notebook does

1. Creates several Python modules:
   - `dsa_data.py` – DSA roadmap and problem metadata  
   - `backend_user.py` – simple JSON-file based authentication  
   - `progress_tracker.py` – XP, badges, and completion tracking  
   - `games.py` – question banks and helpers for coding games  
   - `dsaquest/main_dsa_agents.py` – agentic AI backend using Gemini / ADK  
   - `app.py` – Gradio app that ties everything together  

2. Launches a **Gradio app** that exposes:
   - Home tab: Sign In / Sign Up, user stats  
   - Problem Browser: choose topic + problem, generate AI content, mark complete  
   - Coding Games: Rearrange code, Fill in the blanks, Quiz  

### Dependencies / Keys

- **Gradio** (already available on Kaggle, or install via `pip install gradio`)  
- **Google ADK** (optional: the code works with or without it)  
- **Gemini API key** stored as a Kaggle secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`  

If ADK is not available, the notebook falls back to a **mock agent** so the UI still works and returns placeholder AI content.

# 2. DSA Content Setup – `dsa_data.py`

This file defines the **core DSA roadmap data** used throughout the app.

Key components:

- `TOTAL_PROBLEMS = 450`  
  - Total number of problems in the full Striver-style sheet (used for progress percentage).

- `BADGES`  
  - A simple badge dictionary (rookie / bronze / silver / gold) with emoji names.  
  - Today, only the `"rookie"` badge is actually awarded in logic; others are placeholders for future expansion.

- `STRIVER_SHEET`  
  - A structured dictionary representing the roadmap, broken into **steps**:
    - Each step has:
      - `name` – human-friendly label (e.g., "Learn the Basics")  
      - `description` – one-line explanation  
      - `icon` – emoji for the UI  
      - `xp` – XP awarded per problem completion in that step  
      - `problems` – a list of individual problem entries
    - Each `problem` entry has:
      - `id` – unique identifier (e.g., `"p1"`)  
      - `title` – problem title  
      - `difficulty` – "Easy", "Medium", etc.  
      - `concepts` – list of tags (Arrays, Hashing, Sorting, etc.)  
      - `link` – external reference link (here, placeholder `takeuforward.org`)

**Used by:**

- The **Problem Browser** tab to populate dropdowns and display details.  
- The **progress tracker** to compute per-step completion percentage and to assign XP.

# 3. Simple Local Auth – `backend_user.py`

Since this is a Kaggle notebook environment without a full backend, authentication is intentionally very simple and **file-based**.

### Files

- `users.json` – Stores all registered users:
  ```json
  {
    "user@example.com": {
      "password": "plain-text-password",
      "username": "User"
    }
  }
current_user.json – Stores the currently “logged-in” user:

json
Copy code
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "username": "User"
}
⚠️ This is not secure and is only meant for a single-user / demo environment (like a competition notebook).
